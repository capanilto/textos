The psychologist was preparing to interview the last candidates for that class's fire school. One name caught her attention, bringing up sleeping memories. She separated the candidate's file, looked at the photo, trying to recognize the boy who appeared in the newspapers six years ago, but was unsuccessful. She then decided to leave him last.

After the routine interview of the many candidates, there was finally only one left, the one who had brought back painful memories. He took a deep breath and called him.

- Sit down," she said, indicating a chair when he entered. She watched him closely as he settled in. No sign of nervousness, except those natural of whom he is being tested.

Little by little the images of the past shown in the newspapers became clearer, and she became more sure that it was the same person. At the time only a thirteen-year-old boy, but the traits were unmistakable.

After filling out the forms, the psychologist asked the boy:

- So, young man, why do you want to be a fireman?

- I... - the young man hesitated - I'm not sure how to begin, it's a long story.

The psychologist noticed the nervousness that settled in the boy.

- Tell me everything. Take your time. We have time.

The boy started the story, and right at the first words the memories of six years ago came with strength, vivid. Countless articles in the newspapers, interviews, television reports, everything was mixed with the candidate's narrative, going back to those tragic events.

In the first days of autumn, the capital of São Paulo was punished by heavy rains, causing the rivers to overflow, already saturated by the summer rains.

That day the storm had been sudden, and the Tamanduateí River had overflowed at some points, flooding the marginal roads. Dom Pedro Park, in the center of the city, had turned into an immense lagoon in a few minutes, surprising and deluding pedestrians at the highest points.

A small group was isolated on the banks of the river, on a stretch of pavement higher than the others. There were six or seven people, among them a thirteen-year-old boy. After more than half an hour of torrential rain, it finally seemed that there would be a truce. The river, at that point, was about to overflow. The waters flowing down the streets were flowing into the river in dangerous currents. The small group of people supported each other, waiting for the waters to drop to try to get out of it, going to the highest points. The traffic was totally stopped, chaos was installed in the heart of the city.

Finally a man ventured across the current, and managed to get to the other side, soon followed by a woman. The boy then tried, but barely took three steps, a piece of the sidewalk gave way, throwing it into the river.

Despair over the people, who did not know what to do, saw the boy being swept away by the turbulence of the waters, until a man in the group crossed the water and ran to the bridge, throwing himself into the river. He managed to reach the boy who was struggling, and little by little he drifted to the shore, managing to hold on to a point of protruding iron, about a hundred meters ahead. With one hand he held on to the iron, and with the other he kept the head of the boy out of the water, which was already at the limit of his strength.
It took about forty minutes for a garrison from the fire department to arrive. Together with the firemen, the reporters arrived, in search of sensationalism. One of them managed to position a camera that focused precisely on the two castaways.

A rope was extended, one end tied to the car, the other thrown into the river. One of the firemen came down, and after some effort, managed to get close to the two at risk. The turbulence of the current was very dangerous, dragging all the rubbish it found on the banks. It took her a few minutes to hold the boy tight. When he was ready to lift him, the fireman recognized the man. He was a recently retired firefighter with whom he had worked a few years ago.
- Hang in there, buddy. I'll be right back to pick him up.

Finally the boy was left safely on the banks of the river. The fireman immediately started the descent to rescue his colleague. The current was still strong, and more and more garbage came along with the water. When he was almost reaching his colleague, a rest of the sofa that had been floating, crashed into him and threw him into the water. He could barely hold on to the rope. The piece of couch, however, hit the other one's hand, causing him to let go of the iron tip. The water quickly enveloped him, leading him into the turbulence. The fireman was desperate, but there was nothing he could do. His colleagues pulled him out. Still others ran ahead, bordering the river, hoping to see where the man was being taken. In vain. He had disappeared into the waters.

Meanwhile, the press exploited the uproar that had formed. Some tried to interview the boy, who, confused, did not know what to say and after a few minutes fainted from exhaustion. The fireman who had rescued him was dissatisfied with his failure to rescue his companion, and was taken to an isolated place by his colleagues. The people, who seemed to have multiplied, instead fed the press with multiple versions of events. The images captured during the rescue were already being broadcast live by television stations.

Only two days later, the body of the retired fireman was found, miles later, stranded on one of the banks of the Tietê River.

When she paused in the narrative, a tear came down from the boy's eye, which disguised it as dry. At the same time a tear came down from the psychologist's face, but the boy did not notice, for he was now looking down.

Then he completed it:

- I stayed a few days in a hospital, and I learned the whole story days later. I received a visit from the fireman who rescued me, and he told me who was the man who had saved me. I was actually saved twice that day by two firemen. And that's why, doctor, I want to be a fireman. I owe them my life, and one of them died for me. A hero. I want to be like him.

The psychologist took a deep breath, controlled her voice.

- You want to be a fireman to be a hero?

- It's not really that, it's just that I find a rewarding function. Even if you don't save lives, you don't die for others, in everyday life you're always helping people. It's a worthwhile profession.

- Well, I think it's enough...

The boy looked indecisive. Realizing the boy's insecurity, she added:

- Stay calm. You have a great score, and there's nothing to stop you from being ranked. I wish you good luck, and believe in your dreams.

The boy said goodbye and left satisfied. The psychologist organized his paperwork, filled out the last reports, and closed the file.

In the evening, already at home, after taking a shower, the psychologist opened a file. She leafed through each of the newspaper and magazine clippings that spoke of that occurrence, and which somehow kept her father's memory alive.

Her father, who had saved a boy who today was about to become a fireman, would follow in the footsteps of those he considered a hero.

His father, who had left a vacuum in his life that was difficult to fill. For years she had questioned the fatality that had been that rescue. He, already retired, after thirty years helping people, had lost his life saving an unknown boy. How many nights she had cried with the memory of him, always smiling and confident.

That night, in the darkness of her room, she cried once again, yet she was relieved. The last life saved by her father would be worth it. When he finally fell asleep, he was at peace. She had finally understood that his sacrifice had not been in vain.
