The touching of your arm on mine.
sets me on fire.
makes me an adolescent.
inconsequent.

The hairs that arise.
with the touch of your hand.
turn me back in time. 
rejuvenate my heart.

I never thought I could love you so much.
simply love, as an innocent child. 
who rejoices with a smile.
a glow in eyes.
a flushed face.
walking without care.

The heart burns in my chest.
fast, hasty, happy.
satisfied.
with the touching of your arm on mine.
