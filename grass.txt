On the grass rest, your eyes closed.
Thus I dream of a dazzling planet, 
for on it, you are always by my side.

Alone I am a shy boy, half silent. 
Together with you, I become different, 
I leave my sheepish way behind.

On my face, a smile is stamped, 
I walk joyfully, happily, fulfilled, 
and in my gaze, I reflect your look.

On the grass, I rest, and dream arouses.
In dreams, you are always around.
That's how you want my heart in love.
