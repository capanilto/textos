Scammers can use links in text messages to install malicious code on your phone or launch a phony webpage to collect personal, health insurance, or financial information for use in other scams. COVID-19 text message scams offer cures, warnings about the need for a test, or "special offers." Do not click on links in texts related to the virus, and check cdc.gov/coronavirus for the most current information.

The FTC has posted an alert about a COVID-19 vaccines scam survey. People have reported getting emails and text messages asking them to complete a limited-time survey about the Pfizer, Moderna, or AstraZeneca vaccine in exchange for a "free reward," for which they're asked to pay shipping fees. Do NOT respond to any such message and don't click any links. This is a scam. There's no survey and no reward.

Other text scams are impersonating government agencies. The FCC has learned of a text scam claiming to be from the "FCC Financial Care Center" and falsely offering $30,000 in COVID-19 relief. The text is likely a phishing attempt to get banking or other personal information from its victims.

The Better Business Bureau is warning of a text message scam impersonating the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Recipients are told they must take a "mandatory online COVID-19 test" using a provided link.
